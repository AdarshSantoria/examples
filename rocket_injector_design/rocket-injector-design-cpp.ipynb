    "### 1. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "It was the June of 1962, the company Rocketdyne was tasked with the heavy responsibility of sending a man to the moon as per Kennedy's bold promise. NASA, along with Rocketdyne, developed an F-1 engine capable of burning fuel of Olympic size swimming pool. On the D-day, when the engines ignited and the rocket was ready to take off, the engines exploded and the failure was catastrophic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So, what went wrong?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss the basics first.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rocket system consists of two liquid propellants, namely the fuel ($H_2$) and oxidiser ($O_2$). These propellants are stored in separate tanks, and pumped into the combustion chamber. The chamber houses the exothermic reaction between the propellants to release energy vital for the take-off process. For the reaction to occur readily, an injector mechanism is installed, which disperses these liquid propellants into tiny droplets and allow the mixing of the chemicals.\n",

    " **The Achilles heel**\n",
    " \n",
    "A good injector design makes all the difference between your system performing excellently and it exploding. Unfortunately, the latter was the case for the ambitious project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why so? The devil's in the details. The combustion process creates extreme temperature and pressure conditions inside the thrust chamber. Under such circumstances, the chamber is a very sensible high-pressure cooking pot. Thus, if the influx is off ever so slightly the flames would sway controllably burning down the entire system. \n",

    "### 2. Framing the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the motivation established, let's begin by framing the problem. As discussed, the cornerstone of an ideal rocket system is its injector design. One can infer that the performance and quality of life of the system stand in stark contrast. Both of these are primarily controlled by injector design. This is where multi-objective optimizers kick in. In this notebook, we will try and find the optimal set of design variables to generate a set of [Pareto Optimal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pareto-efficiency.asp) solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To study the effect of the design variables on the said objectives, Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based computations were carried out to retreive an approximate the relation between them via a polynomial equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I. Design Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "The values are normalized to the range [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "a) **Hydrogen Flow Angle** ($\\alpha$) : The acute angle formed between the fuel and oxidiser. \n",
    "\n",
    "b) **Hydrogen Area** ($H.A$):  The area of the tube from which $H_2$ flows in.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) **Oxygen Area** ($O.A$): The area of the tube from which $O_2$ flows in.\n",
